# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that leverages Unsloth's dynamic 4-bit quantized models to provide memory-efficient, grounded text generation. The system will index domain-specific documents, retrieve relevant information based on user queries, and generate responses using a quantized large language model while maintaining optimal VRAM usage through selective precision preservation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load and configure an Unsloth dynamic 4-bit quantized model, so that I can perform efficient inference with reduced memory footprint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load a compatible Unsloth "unsloth-bnb-4bit" variant model
2. WHEN loading the model THEN the system SHALL configure dynamic 4-bit quantization parameters
3. WHEN the model is loaded THEN the system SHALL verify VRAM usage is optimized compared to full precision models
4. IF model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to index domain-specific documents, so that the system can retrieve relevant information for my queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are provided THEN the system SHALL chunk them into appropriate segments for retrieval
2. WHEN chunking documents THEN the system SHALL preserve semantic coherence within each chunk
3. WHEN indexing is complete THEN the system SHALL create searchable embeddings for all document chunks
4. WHEN indexing large document sets THEN the system SHALL handle memory constraints efficiently
5. IF document processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with successfully processed documents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to query the system and receive relevant document chunks, so that I can get contextually appropriate information retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL generate query embeddings
2. WHEN query embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL perform similarity search against indexed documents
3. WHEN similarity search completes THEN the system SHALL return the top-k most relevant document chunks
4. WHEN retrieving chunks THEN the system SHALL include relevance scores for transparency
5. IF no relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL indicate insufficient context availability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive grounded responses that combine retrieved information with LLM generation, so that I get accurate and contextually relevant answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN relevant chunks are retrieved THEN the system SHALL format them as context for the quantized LLM
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL use both the user query and retrieved context
3. WHEN the LLM generates text THEN the system SHALL ensure responses are grounded in the provided context
4. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain coherence and relevance to the original query
5. IF context exceeds model limits THEN the system SHALL truncate or summarize context appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to optimize memory usage with dynamic 4-bit quantization, so that I can run the pipeline efficiently on resource-constrained environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL monitor and report VRAM usage
2. WHEN critical parameters are identified THEN the system SHALL preserve higher precision selectively
3. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN the system SHALL implement dynamic memory management strategies
4. WHEN quantization is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable response quality
5. IF memory limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle out-of-memory conditions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the RAG system through a Colab notebook interface, so that I can easily experiment and iterate on the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notebook is executed THEN it SHALL provide clear setup and installation instructions
2. WHEN running in Colab THEN the system SHALL detect and utilize available GPU resources
3. WHEN demonstrating functionality THEN the notebook SHALL include example queries and responses
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the notebook SHALL provide debugging information and troubleshooting steps
5. IF GPU resources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide CPU fallback options with performance warnings
